The dataset includes 1315 images.
Numbers-Hsrs are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 20 percent of the image
* Random shear of between -10° to +10° horizontally and -10° to +10° vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.1 percent of pixels
